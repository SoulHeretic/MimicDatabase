# MimicDatabase
A small assignment given in Database Design to mimic a database with Java.

Hello. This project is a standard java program, most of the skeleton being given by the professor so you can run it normally.
However, please note that there is no error catching so if your commands are not typed carefully the program may have issues like 
crashing.
